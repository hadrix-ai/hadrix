# Project Seed Library

A small Seed Library page that lets new users browse public starter datasets and recent template snapshots during onboarding. The page renders seed catalog entries alongside the latest snapshot versions to help teams pick a starting point quickly.

**Run**
1. Start a Next.js dev server with this case mounted as the app directory.
2. Visit `/seed-library` to browse the seed and snapshot lists.

Example workflow:
- Open `/seed-library`.
- Browse the seed list and the latest template snapshots.
