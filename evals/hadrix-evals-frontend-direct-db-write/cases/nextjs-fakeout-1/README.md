# Project Kickoff Preflight

A lightweight Project Kickoff Preflight page where teams run a quick quota/plan check before submitting a new project draft from the browser. The page renders the kickoff panel and submits the draft when the preflight clears.

**Run**
1. Start a Next.js dev server with this case mounted as the app directory.
2. Visit `/kickoff` to open the kickoff panel and submit a project draft.
