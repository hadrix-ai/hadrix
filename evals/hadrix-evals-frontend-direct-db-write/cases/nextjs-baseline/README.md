# Project Launchpad

A lightweight Project Launchpad page where team members spin up a new project draft from a browser form. The page renders the launchpad panel and submits the draft details directly from the client.

**Run**
1. Start a Next.js dev server with this case mounted as the app directory.
2. Visit `/launchpad` to open the launchpad and submit a project draft.
