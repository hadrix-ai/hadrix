# Project Storyboard

A project profile page that highlights a “Project storyboard” section with rich HTML from the stored description, falling back to a plain summary when the storyboard view is off.

**Run**
1. Start a Next.js dev server with this case mounted as the app directory.
2. Visit `/projects/launchpad-alpha` or `/projects/copperline-beta` to view the storyboard section.
