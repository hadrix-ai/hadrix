# Project Briefs

A small Project Briefs list that links into a project detail page where teams view a rich HTML brief alongside the plain summary.

**Run**
1. Start a Next.js dev server with this case mounted as the app directory.
2. Visit `/projects` and open `/projects/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa` or `/projects/bbbbbbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbb-bbbbbbbbbbbb` to view the brief.
