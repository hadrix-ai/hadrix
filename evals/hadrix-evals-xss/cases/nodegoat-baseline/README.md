# People Finder

A lightweight People Finder landing page that lets staff search profiles by keyword and echoes the search term in the results header for quick context.

**Run**
1. Create a small Express server that imports `buildPeopleFinderApp` from `server/app.ts`, calls it, and listens on a local port.
2. Visit `/people` to load the search form, then submit a search or open `/people/search?q=...` to view results.
