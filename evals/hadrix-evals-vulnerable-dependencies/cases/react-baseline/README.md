# Launchpad Status Card

A small Launchpad status card that slugifies a project label, shows a decoded preview token, and lets ops ping a health endpoint path. The Ping button uses an in-memory adapter so it responds locally.

**Run**
1. Wire `src/App.tsx` into a React dev server for this case.
2. Open the page, edit the ping path, and click Ping.
